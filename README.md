## Features

Allows you to see how productive you are visually by seeing how much you are typing per hour and see how that compares to other hours you have worked on a project.

## Extra

This thing need to be improved a lot. I did it in three hours for a VSCode hackathon that lasted two days. Big note on the three hours thing, as that is why the extension is so bad.
